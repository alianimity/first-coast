# üìä **Website Improvement Plan & Recommendations**

## **Executive Summary**

After thoroughly analyzing the website against the business profile and services documentation, I've identified **significant opportunities** to enhance consistency, content depth, and user experience. The current website has a strong foundation but lacks alignment with the detailed business strategy outlined in the documentation.

## **üîç Content Gaps & Inconsistencies**

### **1. Missing Core Services**
**Current Issue**: Website only shows 5 services vs. the documented comprehensive service portfolio.

**Missing Services:**
- ‚ùå **Trade & Barter Facilitation** - Completely absent despite being a key differentiator
- ‚ùå **Logistics & Project Management** - Only mentioned briefly
- ‚ùå **Storm-resistant upgrades** - Critical for Florida market but underemphasized

**Recommendation**: Add dedicated pages for missing services, especially Trade & Barter which offers unique value proposition.

### **2. Pricing Inconsistencies**
**Current Website** vs **Business Documentation**:
- Website: "$1K-$50K+" for cosmetic work
- Documentation: More detailed tier system with specific ranges ($1K-$5K Basic, $5K-$20K Standard, $20K-$50K+ Premium)
- **Missing**: Trade service commission structure (10-15%)
- **Missing**: Bundle discounts (10-20% off)
