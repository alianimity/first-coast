# System Patterns

## Operating Architecture
- Modular services linked by a single coordinator:
  Plan/Consult → Source/Bundle → Hands‑On Cosmetic → Logistics/PM → QA
- Outsourcing pattern: route any high‑risk/regulated task to licensed FL subs

## Core Workflows
- Intake & Scoping: standardized checklist; document exclusions and permits
- Estimating: tiered labor rates + material markups + mgmt/commission fees
- Contracting: attorney‑reviewed agreements; waivers; warranty terms
- Permitting: pull only when required; pass‑through fees; inspection tracking
- Scheduling: weather‑aware timelines; sub calendars; delivery windows
- QA/Closeout: photo evidence, punchlist, 30‑day touch‑up policy

## Pricing & Invoicing Pattern
- Transparent line items: labor, materials (with markup), logistics, permits
- Discounts: bundle 10–20%; B2B volume 5–15%
- Deposits: B2C 50% for hands‑on; B2B Net 30 with credit checks

## Risk Controls
- Scope discipline; OSHA safety; insurance minimums; background checks
- Historic/hurricane contexts flagged early; use compliant materials

## Scalability
- Start St. Johns radius; expand to Duval/Nassau with partner suppliers
- Potential franchise/partner play after process maturity
