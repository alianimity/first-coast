# Project Brief

## Company
- Legal name: First Coast Home Remodeling and Repair, LLC
- Location: St. Johns County, Florida (First Coast region)
- Model: Medium‑risk hybrid — consulting + material sourcing + hands‑on cosmetic work; outsource licensed/high‑risk trades
- Mission: Enhance First Coast homes through expert planning, efficient sourcing, and quality cosmetic execution
- Tagline: Remodel, Repair, Renew – Coastal Expertise, Hands‑On Results

## Goals
- Launch a compliant, low‑liability remodeling/repair business focused on cosmetic scope
- Serve B2C homeowners and B2B property managers/agents with transparent pricing
- Build repeatable workflows: advisory → sourcing → hands‑on → logistics
- Establish brand trust locally; scale to nearby counties after validation

## Scope (What We Do)
- Cosmetic hands‑on: interior/exterior painting, laminate/tile floors, cabinet refacing, drywall patching, fixture swaps, trim/backsplash
- Project planning/consulting: designs, budgets, timelines, feasibility, 3D renders
- Material sourcing/bundling: curate, negotiate, dropship non‑regulated materials
- Trade/barter facilitation: value, match, and coordinate exchanges
- Logistics/project management: deliveries, scheduling, subcontractors, timelines

## Out‑of‑Scope / Constraints
- No structural, electrical, roofing, or plumbing beyond cosmetic swaps — always outsource to licensed FL subcontractors
- Jobs follow FL DBPR and St. Johns County permit rules; use contracts, waivers, insurance

## Market & Customers
- Primary B2C: First Coast homeowners and vacation homes (35–70, $100K+ HHI)
- Primary B2B: Property managers, realtors, small contractors; multi‑unit turnovers

## Revenue Model
- Labor fees (hands‑on), consulting retainers, material markups, logistics mgmt fees, trade commissions
- Normal invoice range $500+; bundled projects scale to $10K–$100K+

## Success Metrics
- Lead→client conversion, on‑time delivery %, NPS, repeat rate, gross margin, permit/inspection pass rate

## Risks & Mitigations
- Licensing/compliance → outsource specialists, strict scopes, permit discipline
- Weather delays → schedule buffers, insurance, communication SLAs
- Supply chain variability → local suppliers, alternates, tracked logistics
